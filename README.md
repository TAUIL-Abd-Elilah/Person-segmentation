In this notebook I implement an end-to-end pipeline that can be used as a template for handling image segmentation problems using PyTorch and segmentation_models_pytorch.

Blog where I define image segmentation, discover the right metrics to use in these tasks, explain deeply the notebbok, and talk about some useful applications of it: https://blog.paperspace.com/p/d68eb346-aace-4203-88c6-79f7fcbc7737/
